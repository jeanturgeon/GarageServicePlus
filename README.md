React/NodeJS/MySQL project developped during my college studies. 
This application allows vehicle mechanics to create/modify/deactivate clients (and their vehicles), as well as book appointments for repairs/maintenance. It also offers an Admin dashboard that shows todays's appointments as well as which mechanics are on schedule today. It has an Admin access that allows to create clients/vehicles and employees, and it has an employee access that allows mechanics to add their availabilities for scheduline purposes, and it also has an employee dashboard that shows that employee's appointments for todays and who else is on schedule today. 

In collaboration with Catherine Chartier-Vézina, Stéphanie Fournier-Labrie and Natacha Munoz
